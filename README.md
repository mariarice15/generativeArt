Components:

1 x ESP32 TTGO T-display
1 x Battery

Set-up:
To set-up this installation, the code in HW1.ino was flashed to the TTGO T-display. A battery was attached to the power input of the microcontroller, allowing it to be powered for several hours for the duration of the installation. The battery and TTGO were placed into a white envelope and secured with tape, as seen below:

The envelope contained a cut-out so that individuals may view the display of the TTGO. It was then attached to a popsicle via a string, and hung from the air vents on the ceiling of floor 5 of the Milstein Center.
